			<h1 id="why-i-prefer-linux">Why I prefer Linux?</h1>
<p>I use linux from 5 years I think (on servers), last 2 using it as my daily driver.<br>
I have a desktop pc at home (i5 7400, 16GB, 1060 6GB) that I builded several years ago (maybe 5) for gaming, study and so on.<br>
In last years (or maybe strarting from pandemy) I started to have no interest into gaming, switching to more interesting things like coding, linux&hellip;so nerd stuffs.<br>
I started considering to use linux as my daily driver: first using Ubuntu (18.04 LTS, then 21.04) but at the end Gnome was too clunchy for me, so I move to a more minimal DE, like XFCE (on MX Linux - Debian based distro).<br>
It has been my setup for last 2 years.</p>
<p>Using it was fantastic just because studying linux during using it for daily tasks (work, study, browsing, etc) it&rsquo;s so different when you hate it down your hands everytime.<br>
Configure the entire OS in order to reflect my workflow is really georgious.
Also using linux on a 34inch monitor was literally wonderful, just because I used <em>QuickTile</em> (a tool found on subreddit /linux) that saved me in the windows management. It just works with numpad keys and make possible to move a windows or resizing really quickly&hellip;I will go more indeep on it in another blog post.<br>
But&hellip;</p>
<p>I have always used <strong>Microsoft services</strong>, especially Onedrive, OneNote, Office.\</p>
<h2 id="onedrive">OneDrive</h2>
<p>OneDrive configuration is ok, just using rclone and mounting the remote folder as a local folder.
It requires just few additional seconds in order to open or load files, but it&rsquo;s okay.<br>
Several payed alternatives with synchronization status exist but&hellip;why pay for a service like that?!?</p>
<h2 id="onenote">OneNote</h2>
<p>A <strong>real</strong> replacement for OneNote instead not exist. I tried to move to open source alternatives, without results.
What I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Joplin</strong>:
<ul>
<li>support cloud synchronization (Onedrive, Dropbox, GDrive, etc.).</li>
<li>Compared to OneNote is boring</li>
<li>MarkDown available with an additional (similar) Rich formatting: so no way to features like text color, highlight, etc.</li>
<li>Is not possible to create more notes in the same page like OneNote (as a post-it)</li>
<li>App for Windows, Linux and iOS with more differences: so when I highlight a text on Linux, I cannot do the same on Windows\iOS.</li>
<li>No way to paste external file into pages</li>
<li>No web access</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>CherryTree</strong>: same as Joplin but very basic. Not for me.</li>
<li><strong>OneNote Web</strong>: it&rsquo;s a valid alternative to the app version only when you need to manage few notes.<br>
In fact when I started writign my NSX-T Study Guide on Web version it crashes several times, just because cloud synchronization is unable to following quickly your changes, results in synch errors, lost words or pages that need to be cloned in order to restore note itself.</li>
<li><strong>PX3 OneNote</strong>: Electron based app of Onenote Web. It add a lot of cool feature but bad things mentioned previously remain.</li>
<li><strong>Notion</strong>: mix between markdown and rich formatting. It force you to follow some rules on formatting page that hurts me. NO.</li>
</ul>
<p>So&hellip;I checked if somethings has been changed on Windows in the meantime: I found two cool features called <strong>winget</strong> and <strong>WSL</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="winget">winget</h2>
<p>Do you know Chocolatey? Ok, now it&rsquo;s trash compared to winget.<br>
Winget (aka for Windows Package Manager Client) is a new great feature available at a time only on Windows 10 1809 (build 17763) - Windows 11 - Windows Server 2022 (under testing).<br>
It works in the same way as a linux packet manager, so it make possible to search application, install them or upgrade them.
You just need to open Powersheel and launch command winget search|install|upgrade.<br>
Software sources are MSStore, Certified Comminity Repo, etc. Huge number software exist.<br>
Is also possible to upgrade them in block, using <em>winget upgrade -h &ndash;all</em>: it will start downloading everyone and applying the update without requiring the user nothing (click on buttons, accept something, choose folders, etc.), bypassing all the task required when you need to update a software: download it, launch .exe file, follow update step provided in order to apply the update. What a boring&hellip;</p>
<h2 id="wsl2">WSL2</h2>
<p>Another great feature available from 2015.</p>
<ul>
<li>several different distros available on MS Store (Ubuntu, Debian, Kali, Suse)</li>
<li>GUI linux apps can be launched from the terminal</li>
<li>WSL can be downloaded direclt from MS Store</li>
<li>Linux Files integration in Explorer (so copy-paste to move file between Windows and Linux )</li>
</ul>
<p>Two versions are available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>WSL1</strong>
<ul>
<li>provide fast files access from Windows</li>
<li>real networking management (a IP on your network will be configured for the linux instance).<br>
Useful when an you deploy a webserver and you need to access its services from another pc in the lan.</li>
<li>no linux kernel (so everything is translated in order to be managed by Windows NT Kernel)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>WSL2</strong>
<ul>
<li>full linux kernel available, like to have a complete VM into Windows (without virtualization software in the middle)</li>
<li>fake networking management: when launched a TAP interface (dynamic IP) will be created. So when you need to reach some services from another IP you need bash scripts and powershell commands that automate all</li>
<li>no init system available (<em>service</em> command must be used to manage processes)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m still on Windows 11 from 3 months, using MS tools and the same time coreutils\other cool stuffs on Ubuntu20.04 via WSL2.\</p>
