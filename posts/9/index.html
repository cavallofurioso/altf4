&quot; How the ThinkPad changed the World and is Shaping the Future &quot;
</code></pre>

<p>&quot;
I rushed to visit him because sometimes Japanese executives or engineers literally work themselves to death,<br>
a phenomenon called <strong>karoshi</strong>.<br>
I was relieved to find out that his condition was not serious,<br>
but he was hospitalized for a week with severe headaches.<br>
He had been working every day from 9:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.,<br>
or seventeen hours.\</p>
<p>I am often asked why we worked so hard.<br>
What in particular drove me?<br>
Was it a desire to help Japan recover from war and revive its economy?<br>
I certainly was aware of the need to improve Japan&rsquo;s economy,<br>
and I was aware of Ezra Vogel&rsquo;s book <strong>Japan as Number One</strong>,<br>
which appeared in 1970.<br>
That book was generally recognized as representing the first recognition in the Western World that Japan was maping rapid economic strides.<br>
But I don&rsquo;t think Japan&rsquo;s overall economy was the main motivator.<br>
Nor was the movitation based on the desire to get rich, which is what drives many entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.\</p>
<p>The <strong>simple truth</strong> was taht I was fascinated by the possibilities of new technologies.
And I had developed a fierce loyalty to everyone at Yamato.<br>
We were like family.<br>
Together we wanted to prove something to ourselves, to IBM, and to the world.
